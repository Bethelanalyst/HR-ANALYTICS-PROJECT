Employee Attrition Analysis using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI

HR Analytics Project

Role: Data Analyst
Tools Used: Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI

 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition within a company to identify patterns, risk factors, and actionable insights.
The dataset contains 1,470 employees, of which 237 left the company, resulting in an overall attrition rate of 16%.

The goal is to provide HR teams with data-driven strategies to improve employee retention and reduce turnover.
 Business Questions
1. What is the overall attrition rate?
2. Which departments or roles have the highest attrition?
3. What demographic factors influence attrition?
4. How does performance relate to attrition?
5. What role does job satisfaction play?
6. How does tenure affect attrition?

Data Preparation
- Excel: Data cleaning (removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized formats, treated outliers).
- SQL: Performed exploratory queries to measure attrition patterns.
- Python: Conducted correlation analysis and visualized demographic impacts.
- Power BI: Built dashboards for interactive insights and reporting.

 Key Insights
1. Overall Attrition
-Attrition Rate: 16% (237 out of 1,470 employees).
- Attrition is a significant concern and requires strategic HR action.

2. Department & Role Analysis
-Highest Attrition: Sales Representatives (39.8%).
- Other vulnerable roles: Laboratory Technicians (23.9%), HR Staff (23.1%).
- Lowest Attrition: Research Directors (2.5%).

Sales and entry-level technical roles face the greatest turnover risk.

3. Demographic Factors
-Age: Younger employees are more likely to leave (correlation: -0.17).
- Marital Status: Single employees show higher attrition (correlation: -0.17).
- Gender & Education: No significant impact.

 Retention should focus on younger, single employees.

 4. Performance & Attrition
- Performance Rating 3: 16.1% attrition.
- Performance Rating 4: 16.4% attrition.

 High performers are not necessarily staying — they may leave for better opportunities.

5. Job Satisfaction
- Very Low Satisfaction (1): 22.8% attrition.
- High Satisfaction (4): 11.3% attrition.

 Dissatisfied employees are twice as likely to leave compared to satisfied ones.

6. Tenure
- Nearly half of exits occur in the first year.
- Attrition decreases as tenure increases.

 Onboarding and early career support are critical for retention.
 Tools & Methods
-Excel: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- SQL: Attrition queries and aggregation.
- Python: Correlation analysis, heatmaps, and visualization.
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards and HR insights reporting.

 Visualizations
(Insert screenshots of your Power BI dashboard and Python charts here — e.g., attrition by department, correlation heatmap, job satisfaction vs attrition.)

 Conclusion & Recommendations
- Focus retention strategies on Sales Representatives, Lab Technicians, and HR staff.
- Provide strong onboarding & mentorship for first-year employees.
- Enhance job satisfaction through recognition, career development, and work-life balance.
- Address high performer turnover with competitive benefits and growth opportunities.
